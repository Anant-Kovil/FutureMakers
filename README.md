# FutureMakers

Day 1 Reflection:
I hope to learn more about AI and develop a strong foundation so that I can start to build problems.  One specific application of AI I'm interested in working on is Brain Computer Interfaces.  I would like to be able to use the data from a EEG headset to track emotion and build models based off it to fight depression.  


Day 2 Reflection:
I learned a lot of stuff in Dr. David Kong's leadership seminar.  The main thing I learned was how to communicate your stories in an effective and engaging way.  I believe I'm now more prepared to talk about my story and create meaningful stories.
